# **HEVC-SVS Datasets**

#### Proposed HEVC feature sets along with CNN features from GoogleNet, AlexNet, Inception-ResNet-V2, and VGG16 for TVSum, SumMe, OVP and VSUMM datasets. The new modified datasets names are "HEVC-SVS-TVSum", "HEVC-SVS-SumMe", "HEVC-SVS-OVP" and "HEVC-SVS-VSUMM", respecively.

#### The datasets contain the original ground truth data they came with, and these stayed unmodified.

## The datasets can be downloaded from Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s1RfJTeAesyTQdwOuOSdV3PrZ5r6gbKz?usp=sharing).

#### The following are the HEVC features with their descriptions:

## Upon using any of these datasets, please do cite our publication where we proposed the HEVC feature set for the first time:
